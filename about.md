My name is Musa AtlÄ±han from Turkey. Currently, i am a PhD student in physics and mostly had worked in the field of magnetic phase transitions with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. But lately, i have just focused and been woking on deep learning. And also a self-driving car engineer nanodegree student at Udacity now.
